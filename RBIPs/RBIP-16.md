## Simple Summary

Refactoring of the staking system for efficiency and better readability.

## Abstract

The staking system should be refactored to improve efficiency and readability.

There are several improvements that have very little risk of vulnerabilities and make the system more efficient.

## Specification
- should refactor code
- should optimize storage
- should use new pool registry
- should use new proof of performance address
